## User Story

AS a the owner of a T-shirt printing company I WANT an web-page that gives my customers inspiration for new Tshirt designs with randomly generated quotes and advice, as well as a selection of pre-made designs. I WANT my customers to be able to add the designs to their shopping basket which is also stored in local storage. The total cost of the items will be shown in the basket. 

## Description 

In this project I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Moment.js, Bootstrap and the APIs quotable and adviceslip.com to create an app especially designed for a client with a start-up T-shirt printing comapny. 

The end customer can access the website and can get inspiration for new quotes and advice for their own custom-deisgned T-shirt, or use the pre-made designs and add them to their shopping basket list and to local storage for future reference. 

This product was designed for a client starting up an independant Tshirt printing business.

For now the application is designed only as a demo, however it has the potential to add many more design features and payment method links for the customer to make purchases with. The web-page is to be used directly by end-customers to pick their deisgn and purchase their Tshirts directly from this webpage.
