# TShirt-Design-Station

## User Story

AS a Tshirt designer I WANT an app that gives me inspiration for new Tshirt designs with randomly generated quotes. I WANT to be able to save the designs I like to local storage for a later date. 

## Description 

In this project I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Moment.js and the api.quotable to create an app especially designed for Tshirt printers. 

The Tshirt printer/user can get inspiration for new quotes for their designs, or use the pre-made designs and add them to their 'favourites' list and to local storage for future reference. 

This product was designed for a client starting up an independant Tshirt printing business.

For now the application is designed only with 'B2B' whole-sale Tshirt print-designers in mind, however it has the potential to expand it's user-base and in the future become a fully-fledged Tshirt website to be used directly by end-customers to pick their deisgn and purchase their Tshirts directly from this webpage. 

## Usage

To use this app, simply open the webpage and select from the dropdown buttons the shirt to be saved as 'favourite' along with it's size. To generate a randomly selected quote, click the 'quote generate' button. Upon finding the prefferd quote, click the 'Favourite' button to save both to a list at the bottom of the page and to Local Storage.
